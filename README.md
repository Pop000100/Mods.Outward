# FAQ:
- **How to change the default `Configuration Manager` hotkey?**
    - check out `Outward\BepInEx\config\com.bepis.bepinex.configurationmanager.cfg` :)
- **How to unhide a mod?**
    - tick the `Advanced Settings` checkbox at the top of the `Configuration Manager` window and you will see all hidden mods :)
- **Will mod ___ work online?**
    - It should, but I haven't tested ANY of these mods online, so I can't guarantee :P
- **Will mod ___ break my save file?**
    - it shouldn't, but it's a good habit to backup your save files before trying out new stuff :)
- **I change some settings but nothing happens. Why?**
    - some settings update the game instantly, others have towait for a loading screen, and some even require a full game restart. There's no detailed information yet about each setting, sorry!
- **Can I see the source code?**
    - yep, all my mods are open source and available at [GitHub](https://github.com/Vheos777/OutwardMods)! Feel free to study, clone and/or edit the code as you please :)
